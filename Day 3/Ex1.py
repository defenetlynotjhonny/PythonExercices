Create a database for a bookstore. This database
will manage inventory and customer registrations.
Design two tables, one for books and another for
customers. Each book should include details such
as the author, title, quantity, number of pages,
edition, and price. For customers, include attributes
like name, surname, and birthday. Feel free to
include additional characteristics for both books and
customers. Populate the tables with at least 3
entries.
