- What's for dinner today? In the fridge, there are two
types of meat-based foods: hotdogs and steaks. What
do they have in common? Create the Meat class and
its 2 child classes. Let's not forget about vegetables!
You have carrots, tomatoes, and peppers. Once again,
create the parent class Vegetable and its 3 child
classes. Enjoy your meal!
