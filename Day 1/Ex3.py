"""""
Establish a restaurant menu using functions. In a
separate module, create three functions: the first to
display a list of dishes, the second to select a dish,
and the third to request the bill. In the main
program, input the list of dishes using the keyboard.
Then, call these functions in an endless loop while
soliciting the bill.
