"""""
Implement a login process where users enter the
    correct username and password initially. Following
    this, they can choose to log out or modify the
    password with a new one as many times as
    desired. Password modification is only allowed
    when logged in. Upon logging out, users can
    choose to log in again, considering whether the
    password has been modified.
